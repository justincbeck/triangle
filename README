By starting at the top of the triangle and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 27.

        5
      9  6
    4   6  8
  0   7  1   5

I.e. 5 + 9 + 6 + 7 = 27.

Write a program in a language of your choice to find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt, a text file containing a triangle with 100 rows.
